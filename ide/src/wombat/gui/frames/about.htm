LED Icon Set v1.0 are designed for web designers/developers by Marcis Gasuns, 
Siberia. These .png icons make a professionally looking icon set and are 
totally free.

You can do whatever you want with these icons (use on web or in desktop 
applications) as long as you don't pass them off as your own and remove this
readme file. A credit statement and a link back to 
<a href="http://led24.de/iconset/">http://led24.de/iconset/</a>
or
