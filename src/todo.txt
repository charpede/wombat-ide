Known bugs:
- Petite only knows paths for Windows (easy to fix, I just need the paths)
- It's not possible to select regions of text (possibly because of parenthesis matching)
- Automatic indentation sometimes skips a line
- Reload options doesn't reload open documents
- Reload options doesn't change the Scheme that the REPL uses
- When a document is detached, menu keyboard shortcuts (F5/F6/Ctrl-*) don't work
- Hasn't been tested on Java 1.5 (needed for older Macs)
- Some menu options don't actually work (the keyboard shortcuts do)
- !void is printed (shouldn't it be?)
- No confirmation on autosave (when closing or running)
- Menu options are strange on OSX
- Use the window bar on OSX

Feature requests:
- Tab bar with buttons that duplicate menu functions
- Modify font size
- Implement/test C211  libraries (tree, image)
